## Project Overview

This repository contains two distinct machine learning projects, both of which aim to predict housing prices in Boston based on various features such as air pollution levels, the number of rooms, and building age. Each project uses a different approach to achieve this goal.

### Project 1: Gradient Boosting Regressor for Price Prediction

The primary objective of this project is to build a machine learning model using the Gradient Boosting Regressor algorithm to predict Boston housing prices. This involves several steps including data cleaning, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

### Project 2: Neural Networks with Keras and TensorFlow

In this project, a neural network model is implemented using the Keras and TensorFlow libraries to perform the same task: predicting Boston housing prices. This model attempts to leverage deep learning techniques for improved performance and prediction accuracy.
